/**
 * Indicates that the target method should be called when the {@link Page} it is a member of is
 * about to be displayed in the navigation content panel: after the page's {@link PageState} fields
 * have been updated and before it is displayed in the navigation content panel.
 * <p>
 * When the client-side application is bootstrapping (the page is loading in the browser), the
 * Navigation system waits until all Errai modules are fully initialized before displaying the
 * initial page. Hence, it is safe to make RPC requests and to fire portable CDI events from within
 * a {@link PageShowing} method.
 * <p>
 * The target method is permitted an optional parameter of type {@link HistoryToken}. If the
 * parameter is present, the framework will pass in the history token that caused the page to show.
 * This is useful in cases where not all history token key names are known at compile time, so
 * {@code @PageState} fields can't be declared to accept their values.
 * <p>
 * The target method is permitted an optional parameter of type {@link NavigationControl}. If the
 * parameter is present, the page navigation will not be carried out until
 * {@link NavigationControl#proceed()} is invoked. This is useful for redirecting navigation before
 * a page has been displayed, based on asynchronous logic (for example, to redirect to another page
 * based on the result of an Errai RPC).
 * <p>
 * Page loading can be interrupted by calling {@link NavigationControl#redirect(Class)}. This allows
 * for page redirection rather than proceeding a pages navigation. The target method's return type
 * must be {@code void}.
 * <p>
 * The target method can have any access type: public, protected, default, or private.
 * <p>
 * If the target method throws an exception when called, behaviour is undefined.
