# crysknife

This project is a proof of concept for a CDI-like Dependency Injection framework with a support of some popular features. Itâ€™s based on annotation processors code generation and has no GWT2 dependencies.

Demo: https://crysknife.cloud.unispace.io

At this point Crysknife supports:

* @Singleton and @Dependent scopes
* lazy fields and constructor injections
* @PostConstruct
* transitive injections
* @Named qualifiers and @Produces for custom objects like Elemental2 widgets
* HTML templates
* Data binding

Demo shows how Crysknife is used on a simple page compiled with J2CL (with j2cl-maven-plugin).


Please, remember that this is a POC, nothing more at this moment.
