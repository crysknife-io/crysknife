 * abstract names must be constructed from a series of zero or more valid Java identifiers followed
 * by the '/' character and finally ending in a valid filename, for example, <code>
 * com/google/gwt/blah.txt</code>.
 *
 * <p>
 * The identity of the returned sets and maps will change when the underlying module is refreshed.
